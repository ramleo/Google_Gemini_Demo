Trying LLM demo

This is a very small database of just 5 entries with columns NAME, SECTION, CLASS AND MARKS. This was done just as a demo the process of running the model, creating streamlit app and deploying it on hugginface.

Sample Query: tell me class category and provide class as if marks greater than 90 'first class', marks less than equal to 90 and greater than 80 'second class' else 'third class', only provide name and class, order according to marks
